## Free Trials

### No Charge, No Refund Needed

If you cancel during your free trial period:

- No refund is necessary
- Your access continues until the trial ends

### How to Cancel Free Trial

**Important:** Cancel at least 24 hours before your trial ends to avoid charges.

## Partial Refunds

### Not Available

We do **not** provide partial refunds for:

- Unused time in a billing period
- If you stop using the service mid-cycle
- Features you didn't use
- Subscription downgrades

### Why?

Our pricing is calculated based on access to the full service for the entire billing period, not usage-based.

## Renewals and Cancellations

### Auto-Renewal

- Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel
- You're responsible for canceling before the next billing date
- **No refunds for auto-renewals** after the 30-day window

### How to Cancel to Avoid Future Charges

3. Choose "Cancel Subscription"
4. Confirm cancellation

**Via Email:**

- We'll process within 24 hours

**Important:** Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain access until then.

## Promotional Offers and Discounts

### Special Pricing

If you purchased at a promotional price:

- Refunds are based on the **discounted price you paid**
- Not the regular full price
- All other refund terms apply

### Coupon Codes

- Refunds for coupon code purchases follow the same 30-day policy
- We cannot honor expired or invalid coupons retroactively

## Payment Failures and Declined Transactions

### Failed Payments Are Not Refunds

If your payment fails or is declined:

- This is not a refund situation
- You were never charged
- Check with your bank/card issuer
- Update your payment method to restore access

### If You Were Charged After a Failed Payment

Contact contact@hirefy.careers immediately. We'll investigate and refund if you were incorrectly charged.

## Chargebacks

### Please Contact Us First

Before filing a chargeback with your bank:

1. Email contact@hirefy.careers
2. We'll work with you to resolve the issue
3. Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably

### Consequences of Chargebacks

Filing a chargeback instead of contacting us may result in:

- Immediate account suspension
- Permanent ban from using Hirefy
- Collection efforts for legitimate charges
- Legal action in cases of fraud

We prefer to resolve issues directly and will work with you in good faith.

## Refund Processing Times

### Timeline

5. **Funds in your account:** 5-10 business days (depends on your bank)

### Total Time

- **Fastest:** 5-7 business days

If you paid in a currency other than USD:

- Refunds are issued in the original currency

### Payment Method

- Refunds are issued to the same payment method used for purchase
- If that method is no longer valid, contact us for alternative arrangements

## Multiple Subscriptions

### Separate 30-Day Windows

If you subscribe, cancel, and resubscribe:
